## → What the popup or interaction does?
When the user clicks the button labeled "Click HERE" a popup alert appears explaining how the interaction works. This alert helps visitors understand that JavaScript can create interactive elements on a webpage.

## →	What user action triggers it?
The popup is triggered by the user clicking the button on the page. 

## → Why I chose this intercation? 
As I’m new to JavaScript starting with a click-triggered alert helped me build foundational skills in a easy way.

## → Challenges
Since I have never used JavaScript before it was hard understanding concepts like functions, event listeners, and how to connect JavaScript to HTML. Adding comments helped me keep the code clean and easy to remeber. I also learned the importance of carefully matching the button’s ID between HTML and JavaScript to avoid errors, and to remember that JavaScript is case sensitive.

## → Code Testing
I checked my JavaScript code by loading my webpage in a browser and using the browser developer tool. I opened the Console tab to look for any red error messages. This helped me ensure that my JavaScript runs without errors and behaves as expected when the user interacts with my page.

## → Summary
I have really enjoyed this module as it introduced me to something completely new. Looking at JS in my current role at work, it’s starting to make more sense. I’ve also picked up some of the terms used and feel more confident reading JavaScript code when inspecting pages (kind of!).
