# Monique Lotriet - Front-End Portfolio

## Purpose of My Visual Styling

 I chose earthy and calming tones that blend nicely together to create a warm and clear aesthetic. The background uses a soft beige, complemented by deep reds and browns for headers and buttons. These colors provide good contrast and accessibility, making the portfolio easy to read and professional while also feeling approachable.

## Typography
I chose a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts to create a balance that reflects the tone of my portfolio.

### h1 – 'Playfair Display', serif;
This font was selected for main Heading to give a strong feeling. Its  design helps it stand out and make a bold impression.

### .SubHeader, .SubText, and Form Elements – 'Karla', sans-serif;
Karla is a clean, modern and easy to read. I used it for subheadings, Sub Text text, and form elements to maintain readability. 

### h2 and h3 – 'Lora', serif;
Maintain consistency and it goes well with both Playfair and Karla.

This font pairing creates a warm but professional tone, supports good visual hierarchy, and maintains readability across devices and modes.

## How These Choices Support My Portfolio’s Overall Theme

My theme focuses on calmness to reflect my learning journey. As I progress, I plan to introduce more vibrant colors and dynamic styles to demonstrate growth and creativity. The current calm palette supports a professional vibe. 

## How I Validated My Stylesheet

I validated my CSS using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Reflection on Challenges and Decisions

Styling the feedback form was challenging, especially getting the inputs and buttons to align and look consistent. I researched flexbox layouts and experimented with spacing.

Placing my Projects and Goals sections side-by-side also took some time. I found that planning the layout structure and writing down the content hierarchy beforehand would have made the process smoother.

Overall, I learned that careful planning and validating code early can save time and reduce confusion. I also gained confidence in using CSS basics.
