# My Front-End Journey Portfolio

Welcome to my first front-end web development project! This page was built as part of Task 1 in Module 2 to demonstrate the use of semantic HTML.

## Purpose of Each Section

- **Header**: Introduces who I am and includes a navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the page.
- **Navigation**: A list of links that guide users to About Me, Goals, Projects, and Feedback sections.
- **Main Content**: 
  - **About Me** explains when and why I started learning web development.
  - **Goals** lists what I want to achieve during my learning journey.
  - **Projects** showcases this current portfolio homepage as my first task.


## Multimedia

- I included an image called **Front-End Developer Roadmap** to visually represent the skills and technologies I'm aiming to learn.
- The image is optimized using the `loading="lazy"` attribute and includes proper `alt` text for accessibility.

## Theme Choice

This portfolio is themed around my journey as a front-end developer.
