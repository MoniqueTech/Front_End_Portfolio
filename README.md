# Monique Lotriet - Front-End Portfolio

## Responsiveness Approach
I started my CSS from scratch and used a mobile-first approach. I built and styled the layout for small screens first, previewing and inspecting it in mobile view to ensure everything rendered correctly. Once the mobile layout was complete I added a media query with min-width: 768px and applied only the minimal changes needed for desktop. Most of the styles defined for mobile remained consistent across screen sizes, which made the transition to desktop easier.

## Layout Tools: Flexbox
- I used Flexbox to manage layout and spacing.
- In the Section class I applied Flexbox to display content in a column layout on mobile.
- Inside the media query for desktop, I changed it to a row layout.
- This allowed the sections to stack vertically on small screens and align horizontally on larger ones.

## Design Decisions

### Navigation
- I made sure the navigation bar looked good on both mobile and desktop.
- Used flex to align and space the links.
- I kept the text uppercase, bold, and increased the padding on desktop.

### Structure
- I structured the layout using semantic sections for clarity.
- Used consistent fonts across the designfor body text and for headings.

### Interactivity
- I added a transition effect to the form button so that on hover, the background color changes.
- I  styled my list with a custom heart symbol before each item to make it more visually appealing with my personal touch.

## Challenges & Reflections
- Getting used to mobile-first: At first, it was challenging to start with mobile and then move to desktop. I later realized that only small, minimal changes were needed for desktop, and most styles carry over.
- Display types: I found it difficult at times to remember all the display property options and how they behave. I had to test and adjust multiple times before the layout looked right.
- Overall, the project helped me understand how planning for mobile first can simplify the entire responsive process.
- This was the most chalenngin assignment so far as you can get quite confused while styling everything and what goes where this is why its important to folow a proper structure. 

## Summary
This project helped me build confidence with mobile-first design and responsive CSS techniques. I learned how powerful display flex can be and how a clean structure can make your layout easier to manage across different screen sizes.I'm far from where I want to be but learning the basics has really helped.
